For Windows, change all the `./gradlew` for `gradlew.bat`.

**You should use Gradle 5.5 or greater and Java 8 or greater.**

## Compiling for the JVM (Desktop)

Inside IntelliJ you can go to the `src/commonMain/kotlin/main.kt` file and press the green ▶️ icon
that appears to the left of the `suspend fun main()` line.

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew runJvm                    # Runs the program
./gradlew packageJvmFatJar          # Creates a FAT Jar with the program
./gradlew packageJvmFatJarProguard  # Creates a FAT Jar with the program and applies Proguard to reduce the size
```

Fat JARs are stored in the `/build/libs` folder.

## Compiling for the Web

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew jsWeb                     # Outputs to /build/web
./gradlew jsWebMin                  # Outputs to /build/web-min (applying Dead Code Elimination)
./gradlew jsWebMinWebpack           # Outputs to /build/web-min-webpack (minimizing and grouping into a single bundle.js file)
./gradlew runJs                     # Outputs to /build/web, creates a small http server and opens a browser
```

You can use any HTTP server to serve the files in your browser.
For example using: `npm -g install http-server` and then executing `hs build/web`.

You can also use `./gradlew -t jsWeb` to continuously building the JS sources and running `hs build/web` in another terminal.
Here you can find a `testJs.sh` script doing exactly this for convenience.

You can run your tests using Node.JS by calling `jsTest` or in a headless chrome with `jsTestChrome`.

## Compiling for Native Desktop (Windows, Linux and macOS)

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew linkDebugExecutableMacosX64         # Outputs to /build/bin/macosX64/mainDebugExecutable/main.kexe
./gradlew linkDebugExecutableLinuxX64         # Outputs to /build/bin/linuxX64/mainDebugExecutable/main.kexe
./gradlew linkDebugExecutableMingwX64         # Outputs to /build/bin/mingwX64/mainDebugExecutable/main.exe
```

Note that windows executables doesn't have icons bundled.
You can use [ResourceHacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to add an icon to the executable for the moment.
Later this will be done automatically.

### Cross-Compiling for Linux/Windows

If you have docker installed, you can generate native executables for linux and windows
using the cross-compiling gradle wrappers:

```bash
./gradlew_linux linkDebugExecutableLinuxX64   # Outputs to /build/web
./gradlew_win   linkDebugExecutableMingwX64   # Outputs to /build/web
```

### Generating MacOS `.app`

```bash
./gradlew packageMacosX64AppDebug             # Outputs to /build/unnamed-debug.app
```

You can change `Debug` for `Release` in all the tasks to generate Release executables.

You can use the `strip` tool from your toolchain (or in the case of windows found in the ``~/.konan` toolchain)
to further reduce Debug and Release executables size by removing debug information (in some cases this will shrink the EXE size by 50%).

In windows this exe is at: `%USERPROFILE%\.konan\dependencies\msys2-mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-7.3.0-clang-llvm-lld-6.0.1\bin\strip.exe`.

### Linux notes

Since linux doesn't provide standard multimedia libraries out of the box,
you will need to have installed the following packages: `freeglut3-dev` and `libopenal-dev`.

In ubuntu you can use `apt-get`: `sudo apt-get -y install freeglut3-dev libopenal-dev`.
